                    <h2>What is chiropractic?</h2>
                    <p>Chiropractors are professionals who specialise in the diagnosis and treatment of painful conditions due to mechanical dysfunction of the joints and soft tissues.</p>
                    <p>Chiropractors use their hands to adjust (manipulate) the joints and soft tissues of your spine and limbs where signs of restriction in movement are found,
                    improving mobility and relieving pain.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="chunk">
                    <h2>What conditions do chiropractors treat?</h2>
                    <p>Although chiropractors are best known for treating back and neck pain, which they do very well, patients also consult chiropractors regarding a range of other,
                    related conditions including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lower back pain and Sciatica</li>
                        <li>Neck pain</li>
                        <li>Whiplash</li>
                        <li>Migraine and headaches</li>
                        <li>Shoulder and arm pain</li>
                        <li>Hip and knee complaints</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="chunk">
                    <h2>Will treatment hurt?</h2>
                    <p>Adjusting is not painful. If you have acute muscle spasms or resist the adjustment there may be some discomfort.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="chunk">
                    <h2>What is the popping noise of adjustments?</h2>
                    <p>When the surface of a joint are moved apart rapidly, as happens in a chiropractic adjustment, there is a change of pressure within the joint space.
                    This may cause a miniscule bubble of gas to pop. This sound is not significant and does not hurt.</p>  
                </div>

                <div class="chunk">
                    <h2>Do I need GP referal?</h2>
                    <p>No, chiropractors are primary healthcare professionals, so you can consult us directly.</p>

                    <h2>Can I get treatment on the NHS?</h2>
                    <p>Some GPs are able to purchase treatment for their patients on the NHS. Most health insurance companies will now pay for treatment, although some might require a letter from your GP. 
                    If you are looking to claim back for the treatment, it is best to check your policy.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="chunk">
                    <h2>How long does a treatment take?</h2>
                    <p>The first consultation takes about 60 minutes. This includes a full health consultation and assessment. 
                    After your initial consultation treatment is based on your specific condition, so your appointment can last anything from 10 to 30 minutes.</p>
