        <h2>Attending your appointment</h2>
        <p>Appointments are staggered. This is to reduce the chance of people crossing over when arriving or leaving.</p>
        <p>Please aim to arrive at your appointment time. Wait in your car, I'll come ot the door to wave you in. I'll be wearing scrubs a disposable apron, a face mask and gloves</p>
        <p>You should attend your appointment alone where possible.</p>
        <p>A box will be provided for you to put your belongings in. If possible, please leave them in your car.</p>
        <p>If you walk or arrive by public transport the waiting area will be open as normal. Seats have been spread out the ensure anyone using them will be 2 metres apart.</p>
        <p>If you have a face mask please wear it</p>
        <p>Please bring a hand towel with you. You can use this to rest your face on if you're lying on your front during your treatment.</p>
        <h2>Inside IMSL House</h2>
        <p>Although it is not possible to maintain a 2 metre distance from me during your treatment, please maintain a 2 metre distance from other users of IMSL House</p>
        <p>Where possible try not to touch anything inside the building. 
            The IMSL House door will be left unlocked so you won't have to use the buzzer or touch the door handle - you can push the door open with your shoulder.</p>
        <p>Use hand gel to sanitise your hands when entering and leaving the building.</p>
        <p>Please use the toilet before leaving home. However, if you do have to use the toilet whilst at your appointment, please let me know so I can follow the correct cleaning protocal</p>

        <p>A standard treatment session is now £35. I accept cash or card payments. The UK contactless payment limit has been increased to £45 so anyone wishing to use contactless payment can do so.</p>
